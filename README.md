# ai-integration-lab-api
This api serves a developer blog built with SolidJS exploring AI integration techniques for real-world applications. This project documents my journey implementing LLMs, prompt chaining, similarity search, and other AI capabilities in educational software, while also serving as a hands-on learning project for SolidJS development.
